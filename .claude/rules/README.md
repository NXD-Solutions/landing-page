# .claude/rules

Rules files loaded by Claude Code at every session start. Kept minimal for token efficiency — prose and rationale live in Confluence.

**Every file here must have a corresponding Confluence page under [Claude Code — Rules Reference](https://nordicexperiencedesign.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/NSME/pages/28442625). Any change to a rules file must include a review and update of the corresponding Confluence page in the same PR.**
