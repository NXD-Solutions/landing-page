# Testament

Maintain `~/.claude/projects/<project-id>/memory/Testament.md` — a local log of recurring problems. Never committed; permanent fixes go through a normal PR.

**Add an entry** when the user hints a problem was solved before, or proactively when a non-obvious workaround is discovered.
**Remove an entry** when permanently fixed (e.g. promoted to CLAUDE.md).

Entry format:
```
## <Title>
**Symptom:** ...
**Solution:** ...
**Permanent fix candidate:** ...
```
